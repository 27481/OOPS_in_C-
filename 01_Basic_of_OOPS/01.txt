What is OOPs ?

OOPs is a methodology or paraidgm to design a program using 
classes and objects 

4 Pillars of OOPs 

1> Data Abstraction ->    Show only the required things to the user and hide the implementation (we acchieve it by access modifiers)

2> Data Encapsulation -> closing multiple dataType into a single unit (we acchieve it by using classes)

3> Inheritance -> When one class Inherit some properties from its parent class (just like we inherit some freatures from our parents)

4> Polymorphism  -> Poly means many , morph means forms i.e (acchieving different 
                    functionality using same code ) like(overloading , overridding)



Access modifiers -> Class has a concept of access modifiers 
                    They are of 3 types
                
                    1> Public  -> anyone can access from outside 
                    2> Private  -> no one can access it from outside 
                    3> Protected -> no one can access it but can be inherited
